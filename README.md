# devops-lab-app-services
Led the implementation of an end-to-end Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline
for a Kubernetes-based application hosted on AWS. This project involved configuring Jenkins for Continuous 
Integration and Spinnaker for Continuous Deployment, with source code managed on GitHub. The result was a highly a
utomated pipeline that ensured swift, reliable, and consistent software delivery to the Kubernetes cluster. 
This experience showcased my proficiency in DevOps practices, AWS, Jenkins, Spinnaker, and Kubernetes, emphasizing my 
ability to streamline development processes and maintain a robust production environment.
